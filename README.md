# Coffee Shop Static Website - GitHub Pages Deployment

A simple static website deployed using GitHub Pages as part of a web hosting tutorial.

## 🚀 Task Completed: Deploy Static Website Using GitHub Pages

### What I Did:
1. **Created GitHub Repository** - Set up a new public repository as *giga-R.github.io*
2. **Prepared Website Files** - Used existing HTML (`coffee.html`) and CSS (`styles.css`) files
3. **Renamed Main File** - Changed `coffee.html` to `index.html` for GitHub Pages compatibility
4. **Uploaded Files** - Committed and pushed all website files to the repository
5. **Enabled GitHub Pages** - Configured Pages in repository settings (branch: main, root folder)
6. **Verified Deployment** - Website is now live and accessible via GitHub Pages URL

### 📁 Files Deployed:
- `index.html` - Main website page (renamed from coffee.html)
- `styles.css` - Complete styling and responsive design
- `README.md` - This documentation

### 🌐 Result:
